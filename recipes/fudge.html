                Mix sugar, margarine, and evaporated milk in a large, heavy
                saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring

                constantly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the heat and add chocolate chips; stir until

                Stir in marshmallow cream until incorporated. Mix in walnuts
                and vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer fudge to the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to
                spread out and flatten. Let cool for at least 1 hour before
                cutting into squares.
