        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet; cook and stir green
                onion until softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer green onion to
                a bowl. Stir in crab meat, bread crumbs, 1/4 cup Monterey Jack
                cheese, egg, lemon juice, and dill weed until well mixed.

                mushroom caps in butter to coat. Fill mushroom caps with the
                crab mixture and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Monterey Jack
                cheese. Pour white wine into baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly
                brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
