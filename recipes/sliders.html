            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
            <li>24 mini sandwich rolls</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking
                dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds,
                and dried onion in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate the tops from the bottoms of the rolls; arrange the
                bottom pieces in a layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer
                about 1/2 of the ham onto the rolls; add a layer of Swiss
                cheese and top with remaining ham slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the tops of the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour mustard
                mixture evenly over the rolls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned
                and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into
                individual rolls through the ham and cheese layers to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
